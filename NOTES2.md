### Searching Graphs (03/21/2023)
- Graph searching:
    - Trying to find a node with a specific set of characteristics
- In trees: BFS = Queue, DFS = Stack iteratively or Stack Frame used recursively
- Smallest labeled neighbor: because prof says so!
- Matrices as graphs
    - A matrix is a graph
    - Knights Attack Problem - Research this!
- Directedness & Cyclicity
    - Directed graph has arrows
    - A cyclic graph has a loop (a path leading away from a node that returns back without reusing edges)
    - Directed Acyclic Graph - Useful for real world dependency graphs
- Topological Sort
